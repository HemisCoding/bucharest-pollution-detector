Step-by-Step Plan

1. Data Collection
Latitude/Longitude of known pollution measurement points
Pollution levels (e.g., COâ‚‚, PM2.5, NOâ‚‚)
Date and time of measurement
Traffic data (can be from Google Maps API, Waze, or city open data portals)
Weather data (wind, temperature, etc., which affect pollution dispersion)

2. Preprocessing
Normalize time data (e.g., convert to hour of day, day of week, season)
Engineer features like is_weekend, rush_hour, etc.
Handle spatial data with care: use projected coordinates (UTM or local projection) for distance calculations, not raw lat/lon.

3. Model Options
ðŸ’¡ For Interpolation (Spatial)

Kriging (Geostatistics) â€“ Gold standard for spatial interpolation. Uses spatial correlation.
Toolkits: pykrige, scikit-gstat, gstat (R)
Works well if your measurements are dense enough.
Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)
Simple and fast, just uses distance to weigh known pollution points.
Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
Can handle both spatial and temporal features.
Very powerful but slower on large datasets.
scikit-learn, GPyTorch (for more control)
ðŸ¤– For Predictive ML (Spatio-Temporal)

If you want to combine spatial, temporal, and other features (e.g., traffic):

Random Forest / Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
Input: lat, lon, time, weather, traffic
Predicts pollution at a given point
Fast and robust for tabular data
Neural Networks with Spatial Encoding
Feed lat/lon and other features into a fully connected or spatio-temporal model
Optionally use Positional Encoding for better spatial awareness

4. UI/Map Interface
Use Leaflet.js, Mapbox, or Kepler.gl for map interaction
User clicks â†’ get lat/lon â†’ query model for pollution estimate
Display with heatmaps or point info

5. Bonus Ideas
Use Satellite data (e.g., Sentinel) if you want more spatial coverage
Cluster the city using KMeans and train local models per cluster
Use time series models (like LSTM) if you have time-based data per station
ðŸ”§ Tooling Stack

Python with scikit-learn, geopandas, xgboost, pykrige
Jupyter for experimentation
PostGIS or GeoParquet for storing spatial data
Frontend: React + MapboxGL or Vue + Leaflet
